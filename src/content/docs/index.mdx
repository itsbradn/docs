# Introduction

All APIs built under the "bradn.dev" domain will be organized around [REST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer). 
I will try to keep all API Documentation within 90%-100% coverage and update it whenever there is a change, however due to me being one person I may fall behind occasionally.
If something is missing or not working as it should, please contact me.

All my projects (excluding client projects) are open source and will be available on [my github](https://github.com/itsbradn). For example, this documentation site is completely open sourced [here](https://github.com/itsbradn).
